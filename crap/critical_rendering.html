		<h3>Inlining CSS Where It Matters</h3>
		<p class="content-body">Inlining CSS can be a very simple way to speed up the rendering and perceived performance of your sites. As you'd expect, users want to see something on the screen as soon as possible. It has been observed, that after 300ms without response from an application, users start to perceive delay, after 1,000ms, a users engagement with a task is broken, and after 10,000ms, tasks are frequently abandoned by the user altogether. This can have serious implications on a users engagement with our sites - so, it's important we give our users some type of visual feedback, and fast. By inlining CSS in the head of our HTML, we can give users an almost immediate experience. It's important to inline CSS within the head of our HTML and not as style attributes on HTML elements for two main reasons: Unessecary code duplication happens quickly, and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/">Content Security Policy</a> will, by default, disable the execution of inline styles/scripts. If you're unfamiliar with Content Security Policy, <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/">HTML5rocks</a> has a good introduction to the topic.</p>
		<p class="content-body">Although it can have its drawbacks, inlining CSS can ultimately eliminate render-blocking requests to the server right off the bat. This is a huge performance win against unnessecary latency. Because CSS parsing isn't incremental like HTML parsing, the browser requires the whole CSS file in order to start constructing the CSSOM. This is due to the cascading nature of CSS.</p>
		<p class="content-body--example">On index.html, I've inlined all CSS. Because I can keep the entire HTML file under 14kb, I can serve the entire document within the first round trip to the server. Aditionally, I've loaded the css for the rest of the site, but defered </p>
