		<p class="content-body">Recently, a lot of my time and focus as a web developer has been drawn towards web performance, and I think I know why. Performance on the web has become a very compelling and critical feature. Contraints like low battery mode, inconsistant networks, devices running background processes, ranges in device capabilities... Web Performance is at a very interesting place. There has never been more disparity between internet capable devices in the global marketplace. The next billion users coming onto the web are coming from India, and China, and Pakistan, and markets where devices aren't being produced to optimize features, they are being optimized for cost. At the same time, we have existing markets like the US and Europe that behave .
